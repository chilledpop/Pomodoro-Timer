# Pomodoro-Timer

The Pomodoro technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.


## The Pomodoro Timer implements these steps:
- Sets the focus duration (default to 25 minutes, no less than 5 or more than 60).
- Set the break duration (default to 5 minutes, no less than 1 or more than 15).
- When the user clicks the Play button, the timer starts.
- When the focus time expires, an alarm plays and then the break timer starts.
- When the break time expires, the alarm plays again and then the focus timer starts.
